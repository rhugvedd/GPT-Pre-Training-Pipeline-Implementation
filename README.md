# GPT Model Development from Scratch

## Overview

This project aims to rigorously and fundamentally understand and develop a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the core components and processes involved in building a GPT model, including tokenization, pre-training, and fine-tuning.

## Progress

The project has been under active development for several months and is also currently under active development. Significant progress has been made in understanding and implementing the key components of the GPT model.
Will keep uploading other files as soon as they are tested and in a shape to be uploaded.

## Project Goals

- **Tokenization**: Understand and implement various tokenization techniques to preprocess text data for model training. Understand the effects of tokenization on model performance.
- **Pre-Training**: Develop the foundational architecture of the GPT model, implement and understand the pre-training pipe line.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on specific tasks to enhance its performance on domain-specific applications.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the tokenization, pre-training, and fine-tuning modules will be provided in subsequent updates.
